Issues:
===================
1. How to train every state of the given place, instead of only part of states that between start and goal state?
---------------------

2. Is that possible to train the sub-goals first, then train the final goal using the current Q-table, and we can 
choose different goals by limitating the size of the q_table we use?
-------------------
